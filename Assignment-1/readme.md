# Assignments

These assignments have automatic grading enabled for participation. You can see if the tests pass in the Actions tab for your project on GitHUB.

## Create a file called introduction.md

Put your name in the first line. If your name is Jim Nasium, the first line should look like this:

    Name: Jim Nasium

After that, write at least 50 words telling me about yourself, and your background in programming.

You should commit the file to your repo, and push it to GitHUB.



## Create a file called summary.md

Write a summary of the things we learned about in class today in that file. You should describe each command you learned about. Your file should have at least 20 lines in it.


## Quiz

Answer the questions in [quiz.md](./quiz.md)

## Finishing the assignment

Make sure you commit all the files and push it to GitHUB. This command will probably do what you want.

> git add . && git commit -am "done" && git push
